This is an old project that I knocked up many years ago to do some simple code syntax highlighting. 

Obviously there are much better projects to do this kind of thing, but it was a nice little exercise. You may notice
some code for wildcard expansion which actually comes from one of the Samba project source files - I really need to 
attribute this better here!
